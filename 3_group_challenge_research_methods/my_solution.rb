# code you put after it for each element of the array/hash. I used {} but you 
# can use do-end as well. You can use |x| in the block to indicate how you want 
# to reference each element in your code, or in the case of hashes, |x, y|.

# Reflect!
# I'm not sure if I used the right method for my Person 1 part, but I couldn't think of 
# another method that fit the situation. I only doubt that it was each because I assume 
# it's what everyone is taught to iterate over array/hashes. I did run into some syntax 
# issues when I was trying to refactor my_array_finding_method to make everything fit on 
# one line, but you can see the result up there. This was the first time I used unless 
# in my code because it felt more like natural English than if I were to use if, so that 
# was cool.
